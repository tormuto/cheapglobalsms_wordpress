### Frequently Asked Questions ###

#### How well does this plugin handle 10.000+'s of recipients ####

It works really well; simply send in batches of 3,000 recipients per request. 

#### HELP! I'm administrator and I'm locked out of the two-factor system! ####

If you don't have a backup of the "Emergency bypass URL" from the setup-screen, then you need to dig into the database to disable the two-factor system. Your host probably has a phpMyAdmin that you can use to access it.

Then find the `options`-table, by default `wp_options`. Search for the row where the `option_name` is `cgsms_security_enable`. Simply delete the row.
