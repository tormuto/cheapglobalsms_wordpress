Send SMS'es and enable SMS-based two-factor security.

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to send SMS'es straight from the WordPress back-end or via the programmers API.

Also included is free and really easy to use two-factor security, which really hardens the security of your site.

All you need, is the plugin and a free [CheapGlobalSMS.com](https://cheapglobalsms.com)-account.

Main features:

* **üì± Send SMS / text messages**
  * Import recipient lists from CSV/Excel.
  * Group recipients.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How well does this plugin handle 10.000+'s of recipients =

It works really well; simply send in batches of 3,000 recipients per request. 

= HELP! I'm administrator and I'm locked out of the two-factor system! =

If you don't have a backup of the "Emergency bypass URL" from the setup-screen, then you need to dig into the database to disable the two-factor system. Your host probably has a phpMyAdmin that you can use to access it.

Then find the `options`-table, by default `wp_options`. Search for the row where the `option_name` is `cgsms_security_enable`. Simply delete the row.


== How to use ==
